```js
// We assume you've created your config file and optionally, a conversation setup to use by our bot. This files can be anywhere in your app. The location is completely up to you
// import config from "./[Your config url].js";
// import Conversations from "./[Your conversation url].js";


window.addEventListener("load", () => {
// App available global as ESModule
  const {default:App} = Zuma
  /**
  * We need your consent in order to inject our app in your website
  */
        const launcher = document.getElementById("zuma");
        try {
          const engine = App(launcher);
          engine.startApp();
        } catch (e) {
          //console.log(e);
        }

```

### Bot Conversation Set

```js
const BOT = [
  {
    id: 0,
    title:
      "I'm Glad to have assisted you this far. Please kindly rate my response. 1 means very unhelpful while 5 means extremely helpful.",
    suggests: {
      1: 1,
      2: 2,
      3: 3,
      4: 4,
      5: 5,
    },
  },
  {
    id: -1,
    title: "Whats the plan today?",
    suggests: {
      // 0: "Read Docs",
      1: "Read Docs",
      2: "Get CDN",
      3: "Generate Starter app",
      4: "See more",
      5: "Just chilling ðŸ˜‡",
    },
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    title:
      "We also provide a conversation generator that helps you generate how our bot respond to visitors questions just the way i talk to yoi now.",
    suggests: {
      14: "Learn more",
      1: "Read our documentation",
    },
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    title:
      "Thank you for using our app. Please let me know if you need my help.",
    suggests: {
      0: "You're welcome.",
      1: "Read our documentation",
    },
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    title: "You can clone/fork this project source from our github repo",
    suggests: {
      13: "GOTO:github.com/Itzfeminisce/embeddable -chatbot.git",
      1: "Read our documentation",
    },
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: "Here's the our CDN. kindly copy/paste in your page.",
    suggests: {
      12: "COPY:https://unpkg.com/zuma-ui@latest",
      13: "That's all",
    },
  },
  {
    id: 1,
    title:
      "Great choice! A better way of understanding any project is by taking a glance at the documentations. However, the choice is yours.",
    suggests: {
      6: "Get Started",
      7: "APIs",
      8: "Configuration File",
      9: "What is Intent?",
      0: "Quit",
    },
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    title:
      "Our app is designed with full customisation in mind. You should started by appending our CDN into your page and see the magic",
    suggests: { 2: "Get CDN", 11: "Generate Starter Kit", 1: "Return" },
  },
];

export default BOT;
```

How our conversation file works
Every Object entries have its corresponding [id:Int, title:String, suggests: Array<{Int :String}>] format as you can see above

Object.suggests [id] field points to Object.id giving us the ability of backward compatibility.

Users can navigate from one suggest to another and our bot will just do well by responding with the correct suggest for the next question.

Let us know via [Github Issues](https://github.com/Itzfeminisce/embeddable-chatbot#issues) if any problem occurs during setup.

### Enjoy!
